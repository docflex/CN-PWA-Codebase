# PWA Cache Versioning Example

## Overview

This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that demonstrates **cache versioning** using a service worker. It incorporates various **caching strategies** to optimize loading times and ensure a seamless offline experience. The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it focuses heavily on managing cache versions to prevent serving stale data while still improving performance.

### Key Features:

-   Cache versioning to ensure updates are served correctly.
-   Three different caching strategies: **Cache-first**, **Network-first**, and **Stale-while-revalidate**.
-   Multi-page PWA with multiple routes: Home, About, and Contact pages.
-   Service worker to handle caching and offline support.

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Cache-First Strategy**

-   **What it does**: This strategy is used for static assets (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts). The service worker will attempt to fetch the requested resource from the cache first. If it's found in the cache, it's served immediately; if not, the resource is fetched from the network and then cached for future use.
-   **Where it's applied**: This strategy is ideal for assets that don’t change often (e.g., logos, CSS files).

**Code Example**:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    if (event.request.url.includes('/assets/')) {
        event.respondWith(
            caches.match(event.request).then((cachedResponse) => {
                if (cachedResponse) {
                    return cachedResponse; // Return cached response if available
                }

                // If not cached, fetch from network and cache it
                return fetch(event.request).then((networkResponse) => {
                    return caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
                        cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
                        return networkResponse;
                    });
                });
            })
        );
    }
});
```

### 2. **Network-First Strategy**

-   **What it does**: For dynamic content (such as API calls or frequently changing data), the service worker attempts to fetch the latest data from the network. If the network request fails (e.g., the user is offline), the service worker falls back to the cached version.
-   **Where it's applied**: This strategy is useful for APIs or resources that change frequently, like user-generated content or dynamic data.

**Code Example**:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
        event.respondWith(
            fetch(event.request).then((networkResponse) => {
                return caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
                    cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
                    return networkResponse;
                });
            }).catch(() => {
                return caches.match(event.request); // Fallback to cache if network fails
            })
        );
    }
});
```

### 3. **Stale-While-Revalidate Strategy**

-   **What it does**: This strategy is applied for HTML pages, where the service worker will serve the cached page immediately for fast loading. While the cached page is being served, the service worker makes a network request in the background to fetch the latest content and update the cache for subsequent requests.
-   **Where it's applied**: This strategy is useful for ensuring that users get a fast initial page load while still receiving updated content in the background.

**Code Example**:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    if (event.request.url.includes('.html')) {
        event.respondWith(
            caches.match(event.request).then((cachedResponse) => {
                const fetchPromise = fetch(event.request).then((networkResponse) => {
                    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
                        cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
                    });
                    return networkResponse;
                });

                // Return cached HTML for fast load but update in background
                return cachedResponse || fetchPromise;
            })
        );
    }
});
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Service Worker Installation**:

-   During the `install` event, the service worker caches static assets such as HTML files, CSS, images, and JavaScript files. This ensures that when the user revisits the site, it loads quickly and can function offline.

### 2. **Service Worker Activation**:

-   During the `activate` event, any old versions of the cache are deleted based on cache versioning. This is where **cache versioning** plays a crucial role—by checking the cache version, we ensure that only the most up-to-date cache is kept.

### 3. **Cache Strategies in Action**:

-   When a user visits a page or requests a resource, the service worker applies the appropriate cache strategy:
    -   **Cache-First**: For static assets like images or CSS.
    -   **Network-First**: For dynamic content like APIs (if any).
    -   **Stale-While-Revalidate**: For HTML pages to ensure fast loading while updating content in the background.

### 4. **User Experience**:

-   **Offline Support**: After the initial visit, the app can function offline by serving content from the cache. This makes the PWA experience smooth even without an internet connection.
-   **Cache Versioning**: When the app is updated (e.g., when a new version of the assets is deployed), the cache version is incremented. This ensures that the user gets the latest assets and content instead of the old cached data.
-   **Background Updates**: The service worker continuously checks for updated resources and caches them, ensuring that the app always serves the most recent content.

## What is This Example About?

This project demonstrates how **cache versioning** can be used to ensure that users always receive the latest version of your app, even when offline. It also highlights the importance of selecting the right **caching strategy** depending on the resource type.

The app consists of three pages: Home, About, and Contact, each with simple content. The focus is on caching these pages efficiently and handling updates to the content without causing issues for the user. By using different caching strategies (Cache-first, Network-first, and Stale-while-revalidate), the app ensures optimal performance and reliability.

### Key Features:

-   **Cache versioning** ensures that outdated files are not served.
-   **Cache-first** for assets that don’t change frequently, improving performance.
-   **Network-first** for dynamic content, ensuring the app always fetches the latest data.
-   **Stale-while-revalidate** for HTML content, ensuring fast loading but checking for updates in the background.

## Testing the App

### Steps to Test:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Serve the app**:

    - You can serve the app using a simple HTTP server, such as the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) Node.js package or any server of your choice.

    Example using `http-server`:

    ```bash
    npx http-server -p 8080
    ```

3. **Open in Chrome**:

    - Open the app in Chrome (or any browser with PWA support). You can test the app in a local environment.

4. **Test the Caching**:

    - **Online Mode**: Load the app and navigate between pages. Check the network tab in Chrome DevTools to ensure assets are being served from the cache.
    - **Offline Mode**: Disconnect your network (or use Chrome DevTools to simulate offline mode) and try to navigate the app. Ensure that pages and assets are served from the cache.

5. **Update and Test Cache Versioning**:

    - Change some static assets (e.g., update the CSS or images) and increment the cache version in the service worker (change `CACHE_VERSION`).
    - Refresh the page, and the new version of the app should be fetched and cached. Test the old cached version will be replaced and no outdated assets are served.

6. **Test the Service Worker**:
    - Open Chrome DevTools, go to the **Application** tab, and check the **Service Workers** section. You can also manually trigger a service worker update from this section to see the cache versioning in action.

## What Does It Essentially Do?

This app demonstrates how to implement **cache versioning** and **service workers** in a PWA to handle multiple pages and resources efficiently. The app showcases:

1. The importance of **cache versioning** to ensure users always get the latest content.
2. **Caching strategies** that help improve performance (through `Cache-first`, `Network-first`, and `Stale-while-revalidate`).
3. **Offline support** through the use of service workers and cached assets.

By following the caching strategies outlined, you can ensure that your app behaves well even with limited or no network access, offering a smooth and fast experience for your users.
